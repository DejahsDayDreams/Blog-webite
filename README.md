 Blog webite with a horror theme.
 
 
 I'm excited to delve into the realm of ASP.NET MVC to create a fundamental yet fully functional Blog application. 
 This assignment serves as a platform to demonstrate my understanding of vital concepts, 
 including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, database interactions, and the core principles of ASP.NET MVC. 
 My mission is to build a complete Blog application where users can effortlessly create, read, update, and delete their blog posts. 
 This project not only tests my technical skills but also challenges me to craft a user-friendly interface and maintain well-structured code.
 So, with enthusiasm and determination, I'm ready to embark on this exciting journey into web development with ASP.NET MVC.



color scheme


 Color psychology is a crucial tool in setting the mood and atmosphere of my horror blog. Each of the colors I've chosen plays a significant role in evoking specific emotions and contributing to the overall eerie ambiance:
1.	Dark Green (#0C3027): I've opted for a dark green background (#0C3027) to represent mystery and the unknown. It's reminiscent of deep, dense forests, creating an unsettling feeling of being lost in an ominous, supernatural environment. This color choice fosters a sense of suspense and anticipation for my readers.
2.	Light Green (#99C388): I use light green sparingly to provide a subtle contrast to the darker shades. It symbolizes a glimmer of hope or curiosity amidst the darkness, encouraging readers to explore my blog further.
3.	Pale Green (#E5FFE1): The pale green (#E5FFE1) serves to convey a sense of unease. It can resemble sickly or decaying aspects of nature, contributing to the overall sense of dread and discomfort that is often associated with horror themes.
4.	White (#FFFFFF): White, in my horror blog context, takes on a more unsettling role. It represents purity and innocence but also highlights vulnerability. It emphasizes the stark contrast between light and dark in my narrative.
5.	Deep Red (#EF6351): Deep red serves as a focal point to capture attention and signify danger. It's strongly associated with blood, violence, and intense emotions. The use of this color creates a visceral and alarming impact, intensifying the sense of horror.
6.	Bright Red (#E01E37): Bright red symbolizes urgency and alarm. It heightens tension and reinforces the feeling of imminent danger. This color keeps my readers on edge, always expecting the unexpected.
The combination and placement of these colors in my blog's design and content play a pivotal role in how effectively they evoke the desired emotional responses. When used thoughtfully, these colors collectively create a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, immersing my readers in the world of horror that I aim to convey.
